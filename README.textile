h2. SenCSS - A Sensible Standards CSS baseline
SenCSs stands for Sensible Standards CSS baseline, (pronounced "sense"). It supplies sensible styling for all repetitive parts of your CSS, and doesn't force a lay-out system on you. This allows you to focus on actually developing your website's style.

h3. What SenCSs is and is not

For one, SenCSs isn’t a framework like other CSS frameworks.

It doesn't include a layout system littered with silly classes and pre-set grids, so what does SenCSs do for you? SenCSs does everything else: baseline, fonts, paddings, margins, tables, lists, headers, blockquotes, forms and more. All the stuff that's almost the same in every project, but that you keep writing again and again …and again. *SenCSs handles that for you. _And nothing more_.*

h3. What does SenCSs do for you?
  * Stays close to the browsers base styling, but adding some sense to it
  * Sets a vertical rhythm for all elements (18px baseline)
  * Sets a common typographic standard across browsers
  * Has fonts specified for windows, mac and linux
  * Is optimised, meaning no “double resets”, to make the CSS as efficient as possible

h3. What does SenCSs not do?
  * Force a lay-out system on you
  * Sneak in unsemantic classes
